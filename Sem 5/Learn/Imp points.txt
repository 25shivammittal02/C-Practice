->) Vector in C++ is a class in STL that represents an array. The advantages of vector over normal arrays are,

	We do not need pass size as an extra parameter when we pass vector.
	Vectors have many in-built function like, erasing an element, etc.
	Vectors support dynamic sizes, we do not have to initially specify size of a vector. We can also resize a vector.
